The purpose of these scripts is to allow users to see what kind of codes should be written, and what should not. 

Good codes can be easily profiled by Javascript engines such as V8 and Chakra Core, which allows a more efficient execution. 

Please bare in mind that these scripts are not comprehensive and might not cover all tips. Look around and explore, have fun! :)
